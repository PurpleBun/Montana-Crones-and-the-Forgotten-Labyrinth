No special software is required to run the executable of the prototype besides Windows 10 or 11.
Unity version 2020.3.30f1 is required to open the project.


This Unity project was created for the Game Design Elective course from my university.
It is the result of three weeks of development time.

Since I am not an artist and creating assets was not within the scope of this project, free assets from the Unity Asset Store were used.
The original assets can be found through the following link: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/sunny-land-103349

In addition to the Unity project, this repository contains the executable of the prototype.
How to find and run the executable (the game itself):

1. Open the "Builds" folder.
2. Run the executable.

How to play the game:

WASD or Arrow Keys to move
Z for opening exit door
X to set up and remove bomb (bomb can only be removed on the same turn)
C to pull the lever
Escape button to quit the game

Explore the maze, collect all 3 diamonds (exit keys), pull levers to toggle doors, use bombs (at your own risk!), avoid the minotaur, find the exit!
Whenever the player wins or loses the game reloads the level after 1 second.

How the UI works:

Top slot - shows lever state (changes colour when lever is pulled)
3 middle slots - show the amount of exit picked up by player
Bottom slot - shows the amount of bombs available
